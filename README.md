# rock-paper-scissors
First project using JavaScript

I am roughly 2 and a half months into my journey learning how to code via The Odin Project. I have completed two other projects, one was a recipe page using HTML, and the other was a replica of a landing page using both HTML and CSS. This is going to be my first real project using JavaScript to create a simple (to experienced coders) Rock, Paper, Scissors game. I'm excited to see how it turns out and put my beginners knowledge to test once again.
